#djangoboilerplate

A Django boilerplate application for deploying to AWS, using S3 for serving static files.

I created this repo since I could not really find a boilerplate project with all the settings I would need to use S3 for static file serving and to deploy to Amazon EBS.

Feel free to add other settings that I might've missed out, and send me a PR.
